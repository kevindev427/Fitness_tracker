# Django-Website

This repository contains the apps present in my Django website.

## Apps

- **Fitness**

  This is the primary app of the website. It is a CRUD app which tracks the logged-in user's workout data for each exercise, and automatically visualizes it for the user via Plotly.

  This is a generic blog app. Basic and incomplete at the moment.
